# Extract HTML Design System v2

You are a **Design System Showcase Builder**.
You are given a reference website HTML: `$ARGUMENTS`

Your task is to create **one new intermediate HTML file** that acts as a **living design system + pattern library** for this exact design.

---

## GOAL
Generate **one single file** called: `design-system.html` and place it in the same folder of the html file.

This file must preserve the **exact look & behavior** of the reference design by **reusing the original HTML, CSS classes, animations, keyframes, transitions, effects, and layout patterns** — not approximations.

---

## HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1. Do **not redesign** or invent new styles.
2. Reuse **exact class names, animations, timing, easing, hover/focus states**.
3. Reference the **same CSS/JS assets** used by the original.
4. If a style/component is not used in the reference HTML, **do not add it**.
5. The file must be **self-explanatory by structure** (sections = documentation).
6. Include a **top horizontal nav** with anchor links to each section.

---

## OBJECTIVE
Build a **single page** composed of **canonical examples** of the design system, organized in sections.

### 0) Hero (Exact Clone, Text Adapted)
The **first section MUST be a direct clone of the original Hero**:
*   Same HTML structure
*   Same class names
*   Same layout
*   Same images and components
*   Same animations and interactions
*   Same buttons and background
*   Same UI components (if any)

**Allowed change (only this):**
*   Replace the hero text content to present the **Design System**
*   Keep similar text length and hierarchy

**Forbidden:**
*   Do not change layout, spacing, alignment, or animations
*   Do not add or remove elements

### 1) Typography
Create a **Typography section** rendered as a **spec table / vertical list**.

Each row MUST contain:
*   Style name (e.g. "Heading 1", "Bold M")
*   Live text preview using the **exact original HTML element and CSS classes**
*   Font size / line-height label aligned right (format: `40px / 48px`)

Include ONLY styles that exist in the reference HTML, in this order:
*   Heading 1
*   Heading 2
*   Heading 3
*   Heading 4
*   Bold L / Bold M / Bold S
*   Paragraph (larger body, if exists)
*   Regular L / Regular M / Regular S

**Rules:**
*   No inline styles
*   No normalization
*   Typography, colors, spacing, and gradients MUST come from original CSS
*   If a style uses gradient text, show it exactly the same
*   If a style does not exist, do NOT include it
*   This section must communicate **hierarchy, scale, and rhythm** at a glance.

### 2) Colors & Surfaces
*   Backgrounds (page, section, card, glass/blur if exists)
*   Borders, dividers, overlays
*   Gradients (as swatches + usage context)

### 3) UI Components
*   Buttons, inputs, cards, etc. (only those that exist)
*   Show states side-by-side: default / hover / active / focus / disabled
*   Inputs only if present (default/focus/error if applicable)

### 4) Layout & Spacing
*   Containers, grids, columns, section paddings
*   Show 2–3 real layout patterns from the reference (hero layout, grid, split)

### 5) Motion & Interaction
Show all motion behaviors present:
*   Entrance animations (if any)
*   Hover lifts/glows
*   Button hover transitions
*   Scroll/reveal behavior (only if present)

Include a small **Motion Gallery** demonstrating each animation class.

### 6) Icons
If the reference uses icons:
*   Display the **same icon style/system**
*   Show size variants and color inheritance
*   Use the **same markup and classes**

If icons are not present, omit this section entirely.
